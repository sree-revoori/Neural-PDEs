# Neural-PDEs

This is a short numerical analysis project written in Julia, a powerful mathematical computing language. This project uses machine learning methods to find the solutions to Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). This repo contains two main files - a main file and a nSDE file. The main file finds the solution to the Burgers' Equation whereas the nSDE file implements a neural network to find solutions to stochasticall
